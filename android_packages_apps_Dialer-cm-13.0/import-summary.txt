ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* Android.mk
* AndroidManifest_cm.xml
* proguard.flags
* tests/
* tests/Android.mk
* tests/assets/
* tests/assets/README.txt
* tests/assets/quick_test_recording.mp3
* tests/proguard.flags

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets/
* libs/picasso-2.5.2.jar => app/libs/picasso-2.5.2.jar
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/
* src/com/android/services/callrecorder/common/CallRecording.aidl => app/src/main/aidl/com/android/services/callrecorder/common/CallRecording.aidl
* src/com/android/services/callrecorder/common/ICallRecorderService.aidl => app/src/main/aidl/com/android/services/callrecorder/common/ICallRecorderService.aidl
* tests/res/ => app/src/androidTest/res/
* tests/src/ => app/src/androidTest/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
